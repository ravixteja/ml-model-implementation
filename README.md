# ML Models Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Numpy and Python.

## Structure

- 'collinearity-detection/' : Discusses methods of detecting collinearity of predictor variables in a dataset.
- 'feature-scaling/' : Implementation of 2 popular feature scaling methods from scratch.
- 'gradient-descent/' : Implementation of Gradient Descent from scratch.
- 'linear-regression/': Implementation of Linear Regression without using scikit-learn.
- 'outlier-detection/' : Implementation of 3 most commonly used outlier detection methods - n-Standard Deviation, Z-Score and IQR.
- 'regularisation/' : Implementation of regularisation techniques from scratch.
